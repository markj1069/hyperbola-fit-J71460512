## Introduction

## Types of Hyperbolas

There are two types of hyperbolas:

Horizontal Opening:
:  Open to the left and right

Vertical Opening:
:  Open upward and downward
  
>A number of parameters â€¦ have been defined by convention. We will use Greek letters to denote them, and Roman letters to denote experimental estimates of them [@bevingtonDataReductionError1969, 11].

### Horizontal Opening Hyperbola

The standard form of left and right opening hyperbola is:
$$ \frac{\left( x-\eta \right)^2}{\alpha^2} - \frac{\left( y-\kappa \right)^2}{\beta^2} = 1 $$

where

* x is the coordinate along the abscissa
* $\eta$ is the horizontal center of the hyperbola
* $\alpha$ is the horizontal scale factor
* y is the coordinate along the ordinate
* $\kappa$ is the vertical center of the hyperbola
* $\beta$ is the vertical scale factor

**Note:** The vertical term is subtracted from the horizontal term.

### Vertical Opening Hyperbola

The standard form of an upward and downward opening hyperbola is:

$$\frac{\left( y-\kappa \right)^2}{\beta^2} - \frac{\left( x-\eta \right)^2}{\alpha^2} = 1 $$

where

* x is the coordinate along the abscissa
* $\eta$ is the horizontal center of the hyperbola
* $\alpha$ is the horizontal scale factor
* y is the coordinate along the ordinate
* $\kappa$ is the vertical center of the hyperbola
* $\beta$ is the vertical scale factor

**Note:** The horizontal term is subtracted from the vertical term.

**Warning:** In this treatise, we have assumed a fixed and known coordinate system. You may encounter problems with an unknown orientation to the coordinate system. The fitting will involve determining an angle $\theta$ as well as the other four unknowns.
